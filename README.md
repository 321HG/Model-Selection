# Model-Selection
This is a gui ML project with tkinter. Here we collected some data from the students in the class and applied various supervised Machine Learning algorithm.

The student needs to enter his semester details and based upon his performance it will tell whether the student will be hired or not.

I know it requires a lot of enhancement so I will be updating this  with more models and goos accuracies in future commits
